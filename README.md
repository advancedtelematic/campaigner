# OTA Campaigner

A service to create and schedule campaigns for a given update, targeting all devices in a given device group.

- The Campaigner processes a campaign in configurable intervals, fetching batches of devices (by device group) from the Device-Registry service.
- For each device, it will initiate the given update in the Director service.
- The Director indicates whether the targeted device is affected by the update in the API response.
- For all affected devices, Campaigner tracks the status of the update when it receives the `DeviceUpdateReport` message event.
- For all campaigns, it tracks the count of processed and affected devices, and completed and failed updates.

The API documentation is here:
